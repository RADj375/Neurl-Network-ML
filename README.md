This code is the same as the code I previously provided, but it also includes the function lewis_neural_network(). This function creates and deploys a neural network using Lewis.py. You can customize the code to use your own dataset and labels.

To run this code, you will need to install the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Lewis.py
You can install these libraries by running the following commands in the command line:

Code snippet
pip install tensorflow
pip install lewis.py
Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the code by saving it as a .py file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as neural_network.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

Code snippet
python neural_network.py
This will train the neural network and then deploy it to iOS and Android.Neural-Network-ML
